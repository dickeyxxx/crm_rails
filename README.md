CRM Rails
=========

A demo CRM for my talk on "The Thick Front-End".

There are 4 applications in this series:

* [CRM Rails](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_rails). A standard Rails app with no ajax and an API. Shows the baseline of how most apps are developed today.
* [CRM Rails-jQuery](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_rails_jquery). A fork of CRM Rails that uses basecamp-style ajax.
* [CRM Angular](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_angular). An Angular.js app that interfaces to either CRM Rails or CRM node.js.
* [CRM node.js](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_node). A drop-in replacement for the CRM Rails API written in node.js.
