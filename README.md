CRM Rails
=========

A demo CRM for my talk on "The Thick Front-End".

There are 4 applications in this series:

* [CRM Rails-jQuery](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_rails_jquery). A fork of this application that uses basecamp-style ajax. Designed to show why 
* [CRM Angular](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_angular). An Angular.js app that interfaces to this server.
* [CRM node.js](http://github.com/dickeyxxx/crm_node). A replacement for this server written in node.js.

* API documentation
